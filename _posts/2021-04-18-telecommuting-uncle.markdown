Because I no longer have any formal obligations as a software engineer, I've been focusing on my current telecommuting position of "professional uncle."  My nephews are five and two right now.  The older one has a firm enough grasp on the idea that the Lego movies I make him aren't built out of a secret stash in my closet, so we've determined he should be allowed to look at them without the expectation of coming over and playing with the pieces any time soon.

To create the movies, I use a variety of tools and formats and have come up with a system that Just Works(tm), at least if you're about five.  I'll try to document these because apparently there's a virus going around any everyone is really bored and sick of smoking crack.

First, you might want instructions for your favorite Lego set of your youth.  I've been using [Brick Instructions](https://lego.brickinstructions.com/), which curates actual scans of paper documentation.  I know there are other sources for this information, but I was a child in the late 1980s and this site has served me well for models of that era.


The first piece of software is called "[LeoCAD](https://leocad.org/)."  I don't know a lot about its history, but it's free and open source and seems to have roots in either a piece of software or an open standard called "LDraw."  It's for assembling Lego creations by offering a variety of pieces and the ability to manipulate them. 
 It comes with every Lego piece known to man and the interface reminds me of SketchUp: easily accessible, but clumsy as heck if you have any mastery of the keyboard.  Still, it produces very nice output in a wide variety of formats.  I used to export to [POVray](https://www.povray.org), but now I export to COLLADA with the expectation of importing into Blender and creating a movie.

After you've created your Lego masterpiece, I suggest exporting to COLLADA format, which is the default format expected by [Blender](https://blender.org) under File / Import.  If you want to do an animation, I've found that it's best to group parts of a whole (the pieces of a car, etc) together using "Join" in Blender because some of the keyframe-based animations generate paths you wouldn't necessarily expect.

When that's all done, I scour YouTube for sound effects and you can polish it a bit in terms of video format, timing and other cosmetic things in a video creator of your choice.
