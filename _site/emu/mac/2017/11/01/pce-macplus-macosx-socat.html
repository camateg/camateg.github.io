  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I was able to compile tun support for <a href="http://www.hampa.ch/pce/pce-macplus.html">pce-macplus</a> Mac OS X 10.11, at least on the surface, after a couple of hours of research. Granted, I haven’t made an Internet connection yet, but I’m hoping that this could be because of my inexperience with tuntap on OS X. I wrote some quick notes in hopes that someone could make use of them and get some actual results.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.toughdev.com/content/2016/11/pcemacplus-the-ultimate-68k-classic-macintosh-emulator/">original guide</a> gave me another idea after I re-read it and I actually had a little bit more success with that. Although <a href="https://github.com/freemed/tty0tty">tty0tty</a> relies on a Linux kernel module, another utility called “<a href="http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/doc/socat.html">socat</a>” runs on a wider range of platforms and is <a href="http://brewformulas.org/Socat">available through homebrew</a> for OS X.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>iMac:~ matt$ socat -d -d pty,raw,ignoreeof,echo=0,link=/tmp/modem1 pty,raw,ignoreeof,echo=0,link=/tmp/modem2  
2017/11/22 18:56:55 socat[1708] N PTY is /dev/ttys007  
2017/11/22 18:56:55 socat[1708] N PTY is /dev/ttys008  
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above basically creates a fake null modem cable as originally suggested. The “link” parameter allowed me to maintain some degree of consistency between calling socat; the ttys are allocated numbers at random, but you can link a filename to put in your .cfg.</p>

<p>I chose <code class="highlighter-rouge">/tmp</code> instead of <code class="highlighter-rouge">/dev</code> because even after disabling SIP on the Mac, I couldn’t easily write to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/dev</code>. On a side note, you’ll have to disable SIP eventually to write the pppd options in <code class="highlighter-rouge">/etc</code> because apparently <code class="highlighter-rouge">/etc/ppp/options</code> is hardcoded into pppd.</p>

<p>Here’s the snippet of my config when I configure the serial port:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>serial {  
        port = 0

        multichar = 1

        driver = "stdio:file=/tmp/modem1"
        #driver = "ppp:if=tap0:host-ip=10.10.10.2:guest-ip=10.10.10.3"
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In true form, I got ahead of myself and immediately tried to fire up FreePPP on Mac TCP. I ran pppd as described on the guide with the exception of the device name which is the second generated device from above, <code class="highlighter-rouge">/dev/ttys008</code>. pppd gets angry if you specify a “device” file outside of <code class="highlighter-rouge">/dev</code>, so that’s necessary.</p>

<p>You can use the following commands in separate terminals to monitor the two sides of the “cable:”</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cat &lt; /tmp/modem1  
cat &lt; /tmp/modem2  
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After I had introduced way too many variable into my “equation,” I stepped back and tried <a href="http://www.dalverson.com/zterm/">ZTerm</a> on System 7 and <a href="http://brewformulas.org/Minicom">minicom on Mac OS X</a> through the “cable”.</p>

<p>I chose minicom because it’s much more agnostic about allowing non-standard device names compared to something more GUI friendly and it’s also available on homebrew. I chose the modem port on System 7, which the .cfg pointed to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/tmp/modem1</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">/tmp/modem2</code> in minicom.</p>

<p>When I typed on the emulator I could see appropriate characters on minicom, but the reverse wasn’t true (I saw nothing on the Mac Plus). I had the cat commands running in two other terminals and they produced output as expected for the corresponding cable ends.</p>

<p>Hopefully, someone can take this and run with it to make something usable. I hope it helps.</p>

<h1 id="update">Update</h1>

<p>I guess some time away from this little exercise was helpful. When I came back, I rethought my config file and wondered why I was using stdio. I guess it was just the first thing I tried and I stuck with it for no apparent reason.</p>

<p>I ended up substituting this config line for the serial section:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>driver = "posix:file=/tmp/modem1"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This allowed me to invoke a comm terminal on the “Plus” and communicate as expected. I haven’t gotten pppd quite working yet. They begin to communicate and the Plus / FreePPP gives me a success message, but the connection times out before it’s fully established.</p>

<p>I’m thinking / hoping that there are some nuances between the original guide’s Linux pppd and OS X as well as the fact that I’m using a different approach. The following is some console output from pppd:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Thu Nov 23 23:45:05 2017 : ipcp: returning Configure-ACK
Thu Nov 23 23:45:05 2017 : sent [IPCP ConfAck id=0xc &lt;compress VJ 0f 01&gt; &lt;addr 192.168.2.245&gt;]

Thu Nov 23 23:45:11 2017 : sent [LCP TermReq id=0x2 "No network protocols running"]
Thu Nov 23 23:45:11 2017 : Connection terminated.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If anyone would care to try, here are the steps, in order so far:</p>

<ul>
  <li>call socat as described above</li>
  <li>note the second ttys device’s number</li>
  <li>start pce</li>
  <li>initiate the ppp connection on the emulated Mac</li>
  <li>initiate a yet to be determined pppd command on the OS X host that includes the tty generated from the socat output</li>
</ul>

<p>The last two items could be interchangeable or I might have them backwards, but the “fake success” message was kind of neat to see, even it was a lie.</p>
